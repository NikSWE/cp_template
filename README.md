# Competitive Programming Solutions

Engineers need to solve problems that they have never seen before efficiently and practically. One needs to practice to master this skill. With this goal in mind, I created this repository to store my solutions and share them with those in need.

## Clone Repository

Without further ado, let' s quickly clone this repository so that you can start tinkering with it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muj-programmer/cp_solutions.git
```

## Commit Emojis

You have probably come across a lot of emojis in the commit history or while browsing the repository and tried to figure out what does it imply.
Well let's put an end to this energy-draining task.

| Emoji              | Markup               | Abbreviation | Purpose                     |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| :white_check_mark: | `:white_check_mark:` | AC           | passed all testcases        |
| :x:                | `:x:`                | WA           | fails one or more testcases |
| :exclamation:      | `:exclamation:`      | TLE          | scope for optimization      |
| :question:         | `:question:`         | INC          | incomplete solution         |
|                    |                      | PVT          | private solution            |

__Note:__ _`PVT` is used to keep the solution untracked in git, ensuring that the solution is not available on GitHub by mistake._
